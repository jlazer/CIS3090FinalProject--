This program is allows a user to select ingredients for a sandwhich and they will get a list of what they ordered and the total cost of it.

# Assignment:
Assume you work part-time at a sandwich store. As the only employee who knows java programming, you help to write a sandwich ordering application for the store. 

When the program starts, it first shows a list/menu of sandwich breads and their prices, then asks a user to select a bread by entering a corresponding integer number. A sample output is as follows. 

If the user enters an integer number not between 1 and 4, the user will see an error message.

After the user provides a right number for bread selection, the program asks the user to select vegetables. A sample output is as follows. Again, input validation is needed .

After the user makes a choice for vegetable, such as 2 for olives. The program continues asking for selecting a vegetable so that the user can have multiple vegetables for one sandwich. The user can enter “8” to quit vegetable selection.

After vegetable selection, the program shows meat selection.

Input validation is needed and works as before. Unlike vegetable selection which allows selecting multiple vegetables, meat selection does not repeat after the user enters a valid number between 1 and 5. 

After making a meat selection, the program asks for the user’s name so that the user can enter a name like John or John Smith.
